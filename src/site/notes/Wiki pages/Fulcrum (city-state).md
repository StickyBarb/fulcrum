**Fulcrum** (officially **Evolutionis Civitatem Fulkrum**, also known as the **City of Evolution**) is an island country and city-state in the North Pacific Ocean, bordering Japan to the west and unclaimed ocean to the north, south, and east. The country’s territory comprises one main island and 42 satellite islands and islets. With more than 2.5 million residents throughout the country, most of which is concentrated within the city, Fulcrum is one of the world’s most densely populated countries.

Fulcrum is known for its technological advancements and numerous award-winning scientific research institutions. The city was founded by Strategic Innovations (formerly Lutierre Corporation) and is now governed by its former subsidiary, Akai Dynamics, which has been consistently ranked the No. 1 research institute in the world.

Fulcrum also has one of the highest metahuman populations of any nation in the world, with 32% of its population expressing some degree of extranormal ability. The city has garnered international recognition for its dedication to education, innovation, and fostering the development of exceptional abilities, which makes it a popular destination for researchers and educators.

English is the lingua franca used for administration and legislation, though Latin is commonly taught in schools as well.

## History

### Background (1945-1952)

In the aftermath of the global upheaval resulting from World War II, the Lutierre Corporation acquired a remote island situated off the eastern coast of Japan called Shōtenjima from the Shōwa-era Japanese government in 1945. The island was chosen due to its strategic location and its hydroelectric potential, with two rivers and five planned dams. The conglomerate initiated ‘Project Fulcrum’ to establish a high-security research facility that brought together the best of the best from across the world. Lutierre envisioned a secure, isolated facility where research could be carried out without national or ideological restrictions.

On November 7th, 1952, visionaries, scientists, and inventors from the United States, France, the United Kingdom, Japan, and the Soviet Union were flown in to live on the island. Together, they established a research institute named [[Wiki pages/Akai Dynamics\|Akai Dynamics]]. As a Lutierre subsidiary, Akai Dynamics was financed by voluntary contributions from its Board of Directors.

### Early history (1952-1980s)

Owing to Japan’s record period of economic growth in the post-WWII period to the end of the Cold War, Fulcrum experienced rapid expansion as Akai Dynamics began hiring more staff. Fulcrum saw a large wave of immigration as the Lutierre Corporation, consolidating its global research assets, relocated a significant portion of their operations to Shōtenjima. By the 1960s, Fulcrum had developed into a city of laboratories, advanced manufacturing zones, and residential areas. The Lutierre Corporation encouraged skilled workers, scientists, and entrepreneurs to permanently migrate to the island.

Fulcrum’s technological output led to increasing autonomy. Akai Dynamics commissioned the construction of the first research and training facilities for individuals with potential to develop extranormal abilities.

### Cold War era and independence (1980s-1991)

The 1980s saw a reawakening of Cold War tensions and conflicts, leading to heightened scrutiny of Fulcrum. Fears of escalation and the threat of Akai Dynamics’ research output motivated both Western and Eastern blocs to claim the island. American and Soviet negotiators sought to bring Fulcrum’s scientific output under their control, mounting diplomatic pressure on the Lutierre Corporation to align Fulcrum with one faction. This race extended beyond traditional military assets, encompassing espionage, covert operations, and psychological warfare.

Precautionary measures were introduced to Fulcrum, such as satellite surveillance and tightened regulations on entering or leaving the city. Multiple low-intensity conflicts between the Lutierre Corporation private militia stationed on the island and foreign forces occurred throughout this time period.

Amid rising international tensions, the French government demanded that the Lutierre Corporation place an embargo on the Soviet Union in the interests of preventing further escalation. Due to internal pressure to protect the corporation’s interests, and mitigate the risks posed by external influence and manipulation, the Lutierre Corporation began making preparations to release Shōtenjima to Akai Dynamics and establish it as a sovereign nation.

On February 15, 1985, the CEO of the Lutierre Corporation and members of Akai Dynamics leadership held a press conference in Paris, announcing Akai Dynamics would be taking full administrative control of Fulcrum and claiming Shōtenjima as an eponymous sovereign nation. Akai Dynamics became the first corporate subsidiary in the world to form a new country. The island would be renamed Evolutionis Civitatem Fulkrum, “City of Evolution”.

Fulcrum sparked debates on the role of corporations in geopolitics. Both Cold War superpowers decried Fulcrum’s sovereignty. Fulcrum leadership leveraged the city’s strategic neutrality, presenting it as a global center for innovation, cooperation, and progress, free from political entanglements. Akai Dynamics became the nation’s governing body, operating through a technocratic council of scientists, engineers, and policymakers. The creation of a neutral charter ensured that Fulcrum would not align militarily with any major powers, while diplomatic outreach secured recognition from several nations, particularly those invested in Fulcrum’s research output.

### Present day (1991 onwards)

Following the dissolution of both Western and Eastern blocs, Fulcrum resumed its focus on research. The city's distinct traits have led to international recognition as a beacon of scientific advancement. Fulcrum hosts conferences, seminars, and events for scholars, scientists, and enthusiasts across the world, and plays a unique role in global diplomacy by serving as a neutral ground for international negotiations, fostering dialogue and cooperation between nations without the constraints of traditional political allegiances.

Building on its legacy of metahuman research, Fulcrum is at the forefront of scientific discovery with commercially-available technology ahead of the rest of the world. Seating 45 of the world’s leading scientific institutes, Fulcrum’s research institutions collaborate to explore the potential of metahuman abilities, striving to unlock new possibilities for the betterment of society. Akai Dynamics recruits innovators locally and from abroad to serve as contracted researchers, fostering an environment of cross-continental collaboration.

Fulcrum plays a unique role in global diplomacy as a metropolis that transcends national boundaries. The city serves as a neutral ground for international negotiations, fostering dialogue and cooperation between nations without the constraints of traditional political allegiances.

## Geography

### General characteristics

Fulcrum is situated on Shōtenjima, an island within the North [Pacific Ocean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Ocean) positioned to the east of [Japan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan). This geographical location places the city within an expansive maritime context, characterized by the region's distinct oceanic currents, climatic influences, and proximity to neighboring landmasses. The [Kuroshio Current](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kuroshio_Current), known for its warm waters, flows along the southern coast of the island, contributing to a temperate climate and supporting diverse marine ecosystems. The prevailing oceanic winds moderate temperatures and foster a relatively stable climate throughout the year. The proximity of the city to the ocean contributes to its propensity for rapid weather changes, influenced by maritime air masses and atmospheric conditions.

### Economic effects

The island's eastern proximity to the Japanese coastline situates it within a zone of maritime interaction, contributing to its historical, cultural, and economic ties to the region. Fulcrum serves as a pivotal geographic link connecting the North Pacific to the Asian continent. This strategic location has historically contributed to the city's economic vibrancy, fostering maritime trade routes, cultural exchange, and regional collaboration.
