A **metahuman** is an individual who possesses abilities beyond those of normal humans due to their conscious or subconscious ability to affect reality by substituting their own, personal reality. This is usually due to exposure to unusual circumstances such as the Fulcrum event, but can rarely manifest due to genetic mutations.

Many countries or regions have systems in place to regulate metahumans, ensuring that their abilities are not abused and that they act within the bounds of the law. Specialized government agencies, such as superhero task forces or metahuman control organizations, are often responsible for managing these individuals. In some instances, corporate interests or private entities also sponsor metahumans.

In many places, metahumans are not automatically granted the same rights and freedoms as ordinary citizens due to the potential dangers their powers represent. As a result, metahumans may be subject to special licenses, contracts, or even restrictions on their freedom of action, such as limitations on the use of their powers outside of authorized contexts.
